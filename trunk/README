DESCRIPTION
'Ruby/ActiveLDAP' is a ruby extension library which provides a clean objected
oriented interface to the Ruby/LDAP[0] library.  It was inspired by
ActivRecord[2]. This is not nearly as clean or as flexible as ActiveRecord, but
it is still trivial to define new objects and manipulate them with minimal
difficulty.

For example and usage - read the rdoc in doc/ from lib/activeldap.rb.
It is also available on the web at:

http://static.dataspill.org/projects/libraries/ruby/activeldap/rdoc/

PREREQUISITES

  * Ruby 1.8.x [1]
  * Ruby/LDAP [0]
  * Log4r [5]
  * (Optional) Ruby/LDAP+GSSAPI [3]
  * An LDAP server compatible with Ruby/LDAP: OpenLDAP, etc
  * Examples also require: Ruby/Password [4]


NOTES

  * Only GSSAPI SASL support exists due to Ruby/LDAP limitations
  * The API is subject to change as this package slowly approaches 1.0.0
