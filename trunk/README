DESCRIPTION
'Ruby/ActiveLdap' is a ruby extension library which provides a clean objected
oriented interface to the Ruby/LDAP[0] library.  It was inspired by
ActivRecord[3]. This is not nearly as clean or as flexible as ActiveRecord, but
it is still trivial to define new objects and manipulate them with minimal
difficulty.

For example and usage - read the rdoc in doc/ from lib/activeldap.rb.
It is also available on the web at:

http://ruby-activeldap.rubyforge.org/

PREREQUISITES

  * Ruby 1.8.x [2]
  * Ruby/LDAP [0] or Net::LDAP [1]
  * ActiveRecord [3]
  * An LDAP server compatible with Ruby/LDAP: OpenLDAP, etc


NOTES

  * Only GSSAPI SASL support exists due to Ruby/LDAP limitations


INSTALL

  - Edit active_ldap/configuration.rb with your LDAP preferences
  - Run -
    sudo rake install

RAILS

There is a small rails plugin included that allows the use of a file named
'ldap.yml' in the config directory of your rails app. This file has a similar
function to the 'database.yml' file that allows you to set your database
connection settings per environment. Similarly, the ldap.yml file allows
settings to be set for development, test, and production environments. For
instance, the development entry would look something like the following:

          development:
            host: 127.0.0.1
            port: 389
            base: dc=localhost
            bind_dn: cn=admin,dc=localhost
            password: secret


To install, simply copy the rails/plugin/active_ldap folder into the
vendor/plugins directory of your rails application and create config/ldap.yml.
When your application starts up, the plugin will call #establish_connection
using the parameters specified for your current environment.
