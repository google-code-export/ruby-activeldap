== 0.7.4

* Bugfix: do not base LDAP::PrettyError on RuntimeError due to rescue evaluation.

* Centralized all connection management code where possible
* Added Base.can_reconnect? which returns true if never connected or below the :retries limit

* Fix broken -W0 arg in activeldap.rb
* attribute_method=: '' and nil converted to ldap-pleasing [] values
* Added checks in write and search for connection down (to reconnect)
* Fixed broken idea of LDAP::err2string exceptions. Instead took errcodes from ldap.c in Ruby/LDAP.

== 0.7.0

* ConnectionError thrown from #initialize when there is no connection and retry limit was exceeded
* ConnectionError thrown when retries exceeded when no connection was created
* Separated connection types: SSL, TLS, and plain using :method
* Localized reconnect logic into Base.reconnect(force=false)
* Fixed password_block evaluation bug in do_bind() which broke SIMPLE re-binds and broke reconnect
* Add support for config[:sasl_quiet] in Base.connect
* (Delayed a case sensitivity patch for object classes and attributes due to weird errors)
* Add :retry_wait to Base.connect to determine the timeout before retrying a connection
* Fixed ActiveLDAP::Base.create_object() - classes were enclosed in quotes
* Added :ldap_scope Base.connect() argument to allow risk-seeking users to change the LDAP scope to something other than ONELEVEL.
* Cleaned up Configuration.rb to supply all default values for ActiveLDAP::Base.connect() and to use a constant instead of overriding class variables for no good reason.
* Added scrubbing for :base argument into Base.connect() to make sure a ' doesn't get evaluated.
* Refactored Base.connect(). It is now much cleaner and easier to follow.
* Moved schema retrieval to after bind in case a server requires privileges to access it.
* Reworked the bind process to be a little prettier. A lot of work to do here still.
* Added LDAP::err2exception(errno) which is the groundwork of a coming overhaul in user friendly error handling.
* Added support for Base::connect(.., :password => String, ...) to avoid stupid Proc.new {'foo'} crap
* Add :store_password option. When this is set, :password is not cleared and :password_block is not re-evaluated on each rebind.

== 0.6.0

* Disallow blank DN attribute values on initialization
* Fix bug reported by Maik Schmidt regarding object creation
* Added error checking to disallow DN attribute value changes
* Added AttributeAssignmentError (for above)
* Import() and initialize() no longer call attribute_method=()
* Added error condition if connection fails inside initialize()
* Changes examples and tests to use "dc=localdomain"
* has_many() entries no longer return nil when empty

== 0.5.9

* Change default base to dc=localdomain (as per Debian default).
* schema2.rb:attr() now returns [] instead of '' when empty.
* Lookup of new objects does not put dnattr()=value into the Base on lookup.
* Scope is now use ONELEVEL instead of SUBTREE as it broke object boundaries.
* Fixed @max_retries misuse.
* Added do_connect retries.
* Fixed find and find_all for the case - find_all('*').
* Fixed broken creation of objects from anonymous classes.
* Fixed broken use of ldap_mapping with anonymous classes.

== 0.5.8: Bugfix galore

* Allow nil "prefix"
* Fixed the dup bug with Anonymous patch.
* (maybe) Fixed stale connection problems by attempting reconn/bind.
* Hiding redefine warnings (for now)

== 0.5.7

  (and partially patched).

== 0.5.6

* Added support for foreign_key => 'dn' in has_many.

== 0.5.5

* Remove @@logger.debug entries during build
* Building -debug and regular gems and tarballs

== 0.5.4

* Added Base#import to streamline the Base.find and Base.find_all methods
  - Speeds up find and find_all by not accessing LDAP multiple times
    for data we already have.
* Added tests/benchmark which is a slightly modified version of excellent
  benchmarking code contributed by
  Ollivier Robert <roberto -_-AT-_- keltia.freenix.fr>.

== 0.5.3

* Changed attribute_method to send in associations
  - fixes belongs_to (with local_kay) and inheritance around that

== 0.5.2

* Make sure values are .dup'd when they come from LDAP

== 0.5.1

* Changed Schema2#class_attributes to return {:must => [], :may => []}
* Fixed Base#must and Base#may to return with full SUPerclass requirements

== 0.5.0

* API CHANGE (as with all 0.x.0 changes) (towards ActiveRecord duck typing)
  - Base#ldapattribute now always returns an array
  - Base#ldapattribute(true) now returns a dup of an array, string, etc 
    when appropriate (old default) - This is just for convenience
  - Base#ldapattribute returns the stored value, not just a .dup
  - Associations methods return objects by default instead of just names.
    Group.new('foo').members(false) will return names only.
  - Base.connect returns true as one might expect
* Value validation and changing (binary, etc) occur prior to write, and
  not immediately on attribute_method=(value).
* Attribute method validity is now determined /on-the-fly/.
* Default log level set to OFF speeds up 'speedtest' by 3 seconds! 
  (counters last point which added some slowness :)
* Added Schema2#class_attributes which caches and fully supertype expands
  attribute lists.
* Integrated Schema2#class_attributes with apply_objectclass which automagically
  does SUP traversal and automagically updates available methods on calls to
  #attributes, #method_missing, #validate, and #write
* Added 'attributes' to 'methods' allowing for irb autocompletion and other
  normal rubyisms
* Moved almost all validation to Base#validate to avoid unexpected exceptions
  being raised in seemingly unrelated method calls. This means that invalid 
  objectClasses may be specified. This will only be caught on #write or 
  a pre-emptive #validate. This goes for all attribute errors though.
  This also makes it possible to "break" objects by removing the 'top'
  objectclass and therefore the #objectClass method...

== 0.4.4

* Fixed binary subtype forcing:
  - was setting data as subtype ;binary even when not required
* Added first set of unit tests.
  - These will be cleaned up in later releases as more tests are added.
* Fixed subtype clobber non-subtype (unittest!)
  - cn and cn;lang-blah: the last loaded won
* Fixed multivalued subtypes from being shoved into a string (unittest!)
  - an error with attribute_input_value

== 0.4.3

* Fixed write (add) bugs introduced with last change
  - only bug fixes until unittests are in place

== 0.4.2

* Added ruby-activeldap.gemspec
* Integrated building a gem of 'ruby-activeldap' into Makefile.package
* Added attr parsing cache to speed up repetitive calls: approx 13x speedup
  - 100 usermod-binary-add calls

      Without attr parsing cache:
	real    13m53.129s
	user    13m11.350s
	sys     0m7.030s
      With attr parsing cache:
	real    1m0.416s
	user    0m28.390s
	sys     0m2.380s

== 0.4.1:

* Schema2 was not correctly parsing objectClass entries.
  - This is fixed for now but must be revisited.

== 0.4.0

* Added #<attribute>(arrays) argument which when true
  always returns arrays. e.g.
     irb> user.cn(true)
     => ['My Common Name']
  This makes things easier for larger programming tasks.
* Added subtype support:
  - Uses Hash objects to specify the subtype
    e.g. user.userCertificate = {'binary' => File.read('mycert.der')}
  - Added recursive type enforcement along with the subtype handling
  - This required overhauling the #write method.
    - Please report any problems ASAP! :^)
* Added automagic binary support
  - subtype wrapping done automatically
  - relies on X-NOT-HUMAN-READABLE flag
* Added LDAP::Schema2 which is an extension of Ruby/LDAP::Schema
  - made Schema#attr generic for easy type dereferencing
* Updated rdoc in activeldap.rb
* Updated examples (poorly) to reflect new functionality
* Added several private helper functions

== 0.3.6

* Fixed dn attribute value extraction on find and find_all
  - these may have grabbed the wrong value if a DN attr has
    multiple values.
* Fixed Base.search to return all values as arrays and update
  multivalued ones correctly
* Lowered the amount of default logging to FATAL only

== 0.3.5

* Moved to rubyforge.org!

== 0.3.4

* Changed license to Ruby's

== 0.3.3

* Changed Base.search to return an array instead of a hash of hashes

== 0.3.1

* Updated the documentation
* Fixed ignoring of attrs argument in Base.search
* Fixed mistake in groupls (using dnattr directly)
* Fixed a mistake with overzealous dup'ing

== 0.3.0

* MORE API CHANGES (configuration.rb, etc)
* Major overhaul to the internals!
  - removed @@BLAH[@klass] in lieu of defining
    class methods which contain the required values. This
    allows for clean inheritance of Base subclasses! Whew!
  - Added @@config to store the options currently in use
    after a Base.connect
  - Now cache passwords for doing reconnects
  - dnattr now accessible to the outside as a class method only
* Added Base.search to wrap normal LDAP search for convenience.
  - This returns a hash of hashes with the results indexed first by
    full dn, then by attribute.

== 0.2.0

* API CHANGES:
  - Extension classes must be defined using map_to_ldap instead of setting
    random values in initialize
  - Base#find is now Base.find_all and is a class method
  - Base.find returns the first match a la Array#find
  - force_reload is gone in belongs_to and has_many created methods
  - hiding Base.new, Base.find, and Base.find_all from direct access
* added uniq to setting objectClass to avoid stupid errors
* fixed new object creation bug where attributes were added before the
  objectclass resulting in a violation (Base#write)
* fixed attribute dereferencing in Base#write
* fixed bug with .dup on Fixnums
* methods created by has_many/belongs_to  and find and find_all now take an
  optional argument dnattr_only which will return the value of dnattr for
  each result instead of a full object.
* Base.connection=(conn) added for multiplexing connections
* Added a manual to activeldap.rb which covers most usage of Ruby/ActiveLDAP
* Base.connect(:try_sasl => true) should now work with GSSAPI if you are
  using OpenLDAP >= 2.1.29

== 0.1.8
