= `bind': can't convert Fixnum into String (TypeError) =

This error message may be returned when you use ActiveLdap with configuration file written in YAML. (e.g. ActiveLdap Rails plugin uses config/ldap.yml for that.)

You will see the above message if you specify an all numeric password into your configuration file written in YAML:

  ...
  password: 123
  ... 

In YAML, an all numeric value is converted number not string. But ActiveLdap requires a string for password value. So you need to specify a string not a number:

  ...
  password: "123"
  ...
