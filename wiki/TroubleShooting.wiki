= `bind': can't convert Fixnum into String (TypeError) =

This error message may be returned when you use ActiveLdap with a configuration file written in YAML. (e.g. the ActiveLdap Rails plugin uses config/ldap.yml for that.)

You will see the above message if you specify an all numeric password in your configuration file:

{{{
development:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 389
  base: dc=nodomain
  bind_dn: cn=admin,dc=nodomain
  password: 123
  ...
}}}

In YAML, an all numeric value is converted to a number (Fixnum) and not to a String. But ActiveLdap requires a String for the password value. So you need to specify a String instead:

{{{
  ...
  password: "123"
  ...
}}}

= How to connect to LDAPS server =

Use the ":ssl" method in your configuration file:

{{{
production:
  ...
  port: 636
  method: :ssl
  ...
}}}

Note that "port: 636" is optional if you are using ActiveLdap >= 1.0.2 or trunk. In the version, ActiveLdap guesses suitable port number from "method" configuration.
