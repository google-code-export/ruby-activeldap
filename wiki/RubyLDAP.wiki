= About Ruby/LDAP =

Ruby/LDAP is an extension module for Ruby. It provides the interface to some common LDAP libraries (for example, [http://www.openldap.org/ OpenLDAP], [http://www.mozilla.org/directory/ Netscape SDK] and [http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/en/us/active-directory.aspx Active Directory]). The common API for application development is described in RFC1823 and most libraries comply with it. Ruby/LDAP supports those libraries. 

== Requirement ==

  * Ruby 1.8.x / 1.9.x (at least 1.8.2 if you want to use ldap/control)
  * OpenLDAP, Netscape SDK or Active Directory

== Download ==

 * Download archives from the ActiveLdap [http://code.google.com/p/ruby-activeldap/downloads/list project page].
 * Using version from trunk:

{{{
    % svn export http://ruby-activeldap.googlecode.com/svn/ldap/trunk ruby-ldap-read-only
}}}

== Building ==

extconf.rb will try to use the OpenLDAP 2 or Netscape SDK libraries and guess paths to some header files and libraries from the position of ldap.h. If you'd like to see the available options for extconf.rb, run it with '--help' option.
{{{
    % ruby extconf.rb [--with-openldap1|--with-openldap2|--with-netscape|--with-wldap32]
    % make
}}}
This will create ldap.so, which you can either manually copy into place or
install with:
{{{
    % sudo make install
}}}
If you're building the software on Windows, you may need to use nmake instead
of make.
